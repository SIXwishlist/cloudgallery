This app is built with the NativeScript CLI. Once you have the [CLI installed](https://docs.nativescript.org/start/quick-setup), start by cloning the repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/linfaservice/CloudGallery.git
$ cd CloudGallery
```

From there you can use the `run` command to run Cloud Gallery on iOS:

```
$ tns run ios
```

And the same command to run Cloud Gallery on Android:

```

```
